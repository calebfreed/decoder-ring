# Project Name

## Description

This project is a JavaScript-based application that implements three different decoding processes: Caesar, Polybius, and Substitution. It allows users to encode and decode messages using these encryption methods.

## Features

- **Caesar Decoder**: This feature enables users to encode or decode messages using the Caesar cipher algorithm, which involves shifting each letter in the message by a certain number of positions.

- **Polybius Decoder**: With this feature, users can encode or decode messages using the Polybius square cipher algorithm. The Polybius square is a 5x5 grid with letters of the alphabet arranged in it, and each letter is represented by its row and column numbers.

- **Substitution Decoder**: This feature allows users to encode or decode messages using the substitution cipher algorithm. The substitution cipher replaces each letter in the message with a different letter from a predefined substitution key.

## Installation
